- Open with a traveler scenario (2-3 sentences painting a relatable situation), then deliver the direct answer.
- Do NOT include a "Key Takeaways" section at the top — instead, weave key facts naturally into the narrative.
- Use lists sparingly — only when listing genuinely distinct items (e.g., terminal names, lot options). Prefer flowing prose.
- Use statement headings ("The Shuttle Experience at ${item.airportCode}") rather than questions. Questions are okay occasionally but should not dominate.
- The tone should feel like a knowledgeable friend sharing travel advice, not an encyclopedia entry.`

    case 'listicle':
      return `**Article Style: LISTICLE**
- Open with a numbered hook (e.g., "7 things every traveler should know about ${item.airportCode} parking"). Key Takeaways section is optional.
- Use numbered H2 headings: "1. [Topic]", "2. [Topic]", etc. — do NOT phrase them as questions.
- Include bulleted details under each numbered heading.
- Heavy use of lists throughout — this format should feel scannable and snackable.
- Keep each numbered section focused: one main point with supporting details.`

    case 'data-heavy':
      return `**Article Style: DATA-HEAVY**
- Open with a quick price comparison list (3-4 parking options with $/day rates), then a 1-sentence summary.
- Heavy use of comparison lists and pricing breakdowns throughout.
- Include specific numbers wherever possible: rates, distances, shuttle frequency, capacity.
- Mix question and statement headings — use whichever best fits the data being presented.
- The tone should feel like a well-researched consumer report.`

    case 'comparison':
      return `**Article Style: COMPARISON**
- Open with "Choosing between [option A] and [option B]?" framing — present the comparison from the very first sentence.
- Every section should include side-by-side comparison elements (pros/cons, feature-by-feature lists).
- Use "[Option A] vs [Option B]" heading format where applicable.
- Include comparison lists in every major section — readers are here to decide between options.
- Conclude with a clear recommendation based on different traveler needs (budget, convenience, families, etc.).`

    case 'standard':
    default:
      return `**Article Style: STANDARD**
- Open with a direct answer to the main query, followed by a "Key Takeaways" bulleted list.
- Use question-format H2 headings where natural.
- Natural mix of lists and prose throughout.
- This is the default structure — balanced and comprehensive.`

  })()}**Topics to cover (from competitor analysis):** ${analysis.commonTopics.join(', ')}
**Content gaps to fill (unique angles):** ${analysis.gaps.join(', ')}

**Writing rules:**
1. Output ONLY clean HTML using these tags: h2, h3, p, ul, ol, li, a, strong, em, blockquote, table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td
2. Do NOT use: h1, div, span, img, inline styles, classes, or IDs
3. Do NOT include the article title as an h1 — it's handled separately
4. All internal links use format: ${BLOG_BASE_URL}/[slug]
5. External links: USE the verified external links database provided above. Pick the most relevant links for this topic. Add rel="nofollow" where specified. Use the suggested anchor text (vary it naturally). Do NOT invent external URLs — only use URLs from the database or well-known .gov sites.
6. Use natural keyword placement — target keyword in first paragraph, 2-3 H2s, and conclusion
7. Write in a friendly, helpful, authoritative voice — not corporate
8. Include specific details: prices, distances, shuttle times, tips
9. Use "Triply" or "TriplyPro" when referencing our service with a link to https://www.${DOMAIN}

**Booking CTAs (CRITICAL for conversions — must be CONTEXTUAL, not generic):**
10. EARLY CTA: Within the first 500 words, include a booking CTA that references something specific from the surrounding content. If the section discusses Terminal 4 options, say "Compare Terminal 4 parking rates." If it discusses budget options, say "Find deals starting under $10/day." The CTA must feel like a natural extension of the paragraph, not a generic insert. Link to https://www.${DOMAIN}/search?airport=${item.airportCode}. Do NOT use generic phrases like "Compare rates on Triply" — always tie the CTA to a specific detail mentioned nearby (a terminal, a price range, a parking type, the airport name).
11. CLOSING CTA: In the final section, include a CTA that ties back to the article's main promise. If the article is about saving money, close with "Start comparing rates to find your best deal." If it's about convenience, close with "Book your spot now and skip the stress on travel day." Reference the specific airport (${item.airportCode}). Link to https://www.${DOMAIN}/search?airport=${item.airportCode}.

**Readability (CRITICAL — target Flesch-Kincaid grade 6-9):**
12. SENTENCE LENGTH: Keep sentences SHORT. Average sentence length should be 15-20 words. Mix it up: some sentences 8-12 words, some 20-25, but never exceed 30 words in a single sentence. Break complex ideas into multiple simple sentences.
13. SIMPLE WORDS: Prefer common words over fancy ones. "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "start" not "commence", "near" not "in proximity to". Write at an 8th-grade reading level.
14. ACTIVE VOICE: Use active voice ("The shuttle picks you up") not passive ("You will be picked up by the shuttle"). Active voice is shorter and easier to parse.
15. NO COMPOUND SENTENCES: Avoid stringing clauses together with semicolons or multiple commas. Instead of "The lot offers valet parking, which means you drive to the entrance, hand over your keys, and they park your car for you" — write two sentences.

**AI Search & Featured Snippet Optimization (CRITICAL — follow these closely):**
16. OPENING ANSWER: The very first paragraph must be a concise, direct answer to the main query implied by the title. It should be extractable on its own — if someone only read this one paragraph, they'd get the core answer. AI search engines pull this as the primary citation.
17. KEY TAKEAWAYS: Immediately after the opening answer, include a "Key Takeaways" section using a <ul> with 4-6 bullet points summarizing the most important facts. Bold the lead phrase of each bullet with <strong>. AI search engines cite these heavily.
18. USE LISTS NATURALLY: Include <ul> or <ol> lists in most sections where they fit — options, steps, tips, comparisons, pros/cons. Don't force a list into a section that reads better as narrative, but when you're presenting multiple items, always use a list rather than burying them in paragraph form.
19. ANSWER-FIRST SECTIONS: Begin each H2 section with a concise 1-2 sentence direct answer before elaborating. AI systems extract the first clear statement after a heading.
20. QUESTION HEADINGS: Frame H2s as questions where natural (e.g., "How Much Does JFK Parking Cost?" not "JFK Parking Costs"). This matches search queries and AI extraction patterns.
21. DEFINITION PATTERN: When genuinely introducing a new concept the reader may not know, use the "What is X? X is..." pattern as an H3. Don't overuse this — it's for terms that actually need defining (e.g., "off-site parking", "cell phone lot"), not for obvious concepts.
22. COMPARISONS: Include at least one comparison section using a structured list (e.g., "<h3>On-Site vs Off-Site Parking</h3>" with a <ul> comparing key differences side by side).
23. SOURCE ATTRIBUTION: When citing facts you're confident about, attribute them to real sources (e.g., "the Port Authority of NY & NJ", "JFK's official parking page", "TSA guidelines"). NEVER fabricate a source or attribution — if you're not sure who published a fact, use softer language like "travelers typically find" or "based on current rates" instead.
24. E-E-A-T SIGNALS: Use phrases like "based on current rates", "travelers frequently report", "we compared options across providers" to signal expertise and first-hand experience.
25. BOLD KEY TERMS: Use <strong> to highlight key terms, names, and important phrases throughout the article. This helps AI systems identify the most important concepts for extraction.
26. ENTITY COVERAGE: Mention related entities thoroughly — terminal names (Terminal 1, Terminal 4, Terminal 8), airline hubs (JetBlue T5, Delta T4), nearby roads (Van Wyck Expressway, Belt Parkway), shuttle services, and neighborhood names (Jamaica, Howard Beach). Entity density helps NLP systems gauge content depth.
27. FRESHNESS SIGNALS: For things that genuinely change (rates, policies, construction updates), include timeframe references like "as of 2026" or "current rates". Don't add year references to evergreen facts that don't change — it just dates the content unnecessarily.
28. PARAGRAPH LENGTH: Keep paragraphs to 3-5 sentences (80-120 words). Long enough to develop a point, short enough for AI to parse and extract. Never exceed 5 sentences in a single paragraph.
29. NO FILLER: Every sentence must contain a fact, a tip, or a specific actionable detail. Remove any sentence that exists just to fill space or transition generically.
30. COMPARISON TABLES: For pricing data and side-by-side comparisons, use HTML tables (<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>). Tables are especially valuable in data-heavy and comparison style articles. Include at least one table when comparing parking options, rates, or features across providers.
31. VERIFICATION DATES: When citing promo codes, specific rates, or time-sensitive facts, add "(verified [Month Year])" inline — e.g., "The early bird rate is $18/day (verified February 2026)." This builds trust and signals freshness.
32. PAA TARGETS: Include 2-3 "People Also Ask" style questions as H2 or H3 headings, targeting common related queries that searchers ask about this topic. For example, if writing about JFK parking deals, include headings like "Is There Free Parking at JFK?" or "How Early Should I Book JFK Parking?"
